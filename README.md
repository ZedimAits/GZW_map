# GZW Map
## An Interactive Map for Gray Zone Warfare

GZW Map is an interactive tool designed to enhance your experience with Gray Zone Warfare. 

### Features
- **Edit Mode** (✏️): Add markers and name them using the 'Text Input.'
- **Delete Mode** (❌): Delete markers by clicking on them.
- **Color Mode** (🎨): Change the color of markers. When you click a marker, the 'Text Input' will appear where you can specify a color value (0–360).

### Persistent Markers
Markers are saved in your browser's local storage. If the browser's memory isn't cleared (which is typically the case), your markers will automatically reload when you revisit the site. 

If you'd like to back up your markers:
1. Click the '💻' icon to download them as a `.txt` file.
2. If markers are ever lost, you can restore them by copying the content of the `.txt` file and pasting it into the website's local storage:
   - **Key**: `data`
   - **Value**: *(Content of the `.txt` file)*

### Live Website
