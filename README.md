# GZW Map  
## An Interactive Map for Gray Zone Warfare  

GZW Map is an interactive map designed to enhance your experience with Gray Zone Warfare.  
With this tool, you can add markers, include descriptions, and customize their colors to highlight specific points of interest.  

### Features  
- **Edit Mode** (✏️): Add markers and assign names or descriptions using the 'Text Input.'  
- **Delete Mode** (❌): Remove markers by simply clicking on them.  
- **Color Mode** (🎨): Change marker colors. Click on a marker, and the 'Text Input' will appear, allowing you to specify a color value between 0 and 360.  

### Persistent Markers  
Markers are saved in your browser's local storage. If the browser's memory isn't cleared (as is typically the case), your markers will automatically reload when revisiting the site.  

#### Backup and Restore  
- **Backup**: Download your markers as a `.txt` file by clicking the '💻' icon.  
- **Restore**:  
  - Click the '📤' icon to upload a previously downloaded `.txt` file.  
  - The file should contain a valid JSON string representing your markers. The map will be updated accordingly.
